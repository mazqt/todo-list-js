Before:
In this project, I aim to use javascript to create a website that lets you create and organize tasks to keep track of things you have to do. My skeleton is a Task class, which will be rather basic and functional, a view module that will use a lot of dom manipulation to render the correct tasks and elements, as well as a memory module to handle the localStorage.
