          This handy little webapp allows you to note down tasks. They're saved
          locally on your computer and persist when you turn off your browser.
          You can either view all of your tasks, or select which project to view
          with the dropdown bar below. Regardless of which project you choose,
          they'll be sorted by date, and any tasks that coincide on the same day
          are then sorted by priority.
